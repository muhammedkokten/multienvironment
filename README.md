Project for creating multiple virtual environments through a web application. The main purpose of the project is to modify the venv environment via the web application. After installing the relevant files for the project to run, you need to create five venv environments named "Venv, Venv2, Venv3, Venv4, Venv5". The project is designed to work on Windows. You can access the Linux version from my repositories.
